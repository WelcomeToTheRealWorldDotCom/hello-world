# hello-world
This is for practicing GitHub Flow.
I am 37 years old and started back to school at Strtayer Unviersitry last year. I am working towards my first Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a cybersecurity speacialization. I am excited to get startedd with the current class Compter programming Design. This is how I came across the GitHub website. Of course this is not my first encounter with Github. I have always known about it, I just never used it for coding. Since I am learning Python now, I am sure that it will be agreat necessity for me.
